### 문제 설명

<p>A <em>trident</em> is a fork with three tines (prongs). A simple picture of a trident can be made from asterisks and spaces:</p>

<pre>*  *  *
*  *  *
*  *  *
*******
   *
   *
   *
   *
</pre>

<p>In this example, each tine is a vertical column of 3 asterisks. Each tine is separated by 2 spaces. The handle is a vertical column of 4 asterisks below the middle tine.</p>

<p>Tridents of various shapes can be drawn by varying three parameters: $t$, the height of the tines, $s$, the spacing between tines, and $h$, the length of the handle. For the example above we have $t = 3$, $s = 2$, and $h = 4$.</p>

<p>You are to write an interactive program to print a trident. Your program should accept as input the parameters $t$, $s$, and $h$, and print the appropriate trident. You can assume that $t$, $s$, $h$ are each at least 0 and not larger than 10.</p>
