### 문제 설명

<p>A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of characters which reads the same backwards or forwards. Given a string of lower case letters, can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character? Note that the size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>Up to 30 lines each containing from 3 to 30 lower case letters. The final line will just contain # - do not process this line.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If it is possible to make a palindrome from the text by deleting one letter, display the palindrome text. If it is not possible, display not possible.</p>

<p>It may be possible to make more than one palindrome by deleting a single letter. For example, madmam will become mamam if the d is deleted, or madam if the middle m is deleted. In such a case, display the palindrome formed by deleting the earliest letter from the text.</p>
