### 문제 설명

<p>Thore is a visiting scholar at a progressive university, whose administrators have decided that gendered pronouns are politically incorrect. The pronouns <em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>him</em>, and <em>her</em> must be replaced with the gender neutral <em>they</em> and <em>them</em>. Thore doesn't want to appear old-fashioned but has difficulties adapting. To condition themselves to speak properly, he -- sorry, they -- have programmed a behaviour-improving wearable wristband to analyse their speech and give them an electric shock every time he -- <em>buzz</em> -- uses one of the forbidden words (<em>he</em>, <em>him</em>, <em>she</em>, or <em>her</em>). Thore is worried that he -- <em>buzz</em> -- will be electrocuted and needs your help to determine how many electric shocks he -- <em>buzz</em> -- will receive from different sentences.</p>

### 입력
