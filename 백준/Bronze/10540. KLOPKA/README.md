### 문제 설명

<p>The city of Osijek has recently been plagued by a swarm of mosquitoes. The solution to this problem was proposed long ago by Mr. Perić, a brave inventor from Benkovci, in an episode of the TV-show Gitak called "Globalno sjelo"<sup>1</sup>. Among other  inspiring inventions, he presented a mosquito trap. It is basically a box with which you cover the mosquito after it falls for the  piece of cheese or "kajmak" you placed there, depending on what your mosquitoes prefer. Simple, isn't it? </p>

<p>If you're lucky, the box can cover more than one mosquito. You have spotted N mosquitoes on the table and know their  positions precisely. What is the area of the smallest square-shaped box that can, placed parallel to the sides of the  table, cover all the mosquitoes? The box, of course, can cover the mosquito with its edge. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 20), the number of spotted mosquitoes. </p>

<p>Each of the following N lines contains the positions of mosquitoes as space-separated integer coordinates X and Y (1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100) in an imaginary coordinate system whose axes are the sides of the table. At least two mosquitoes will be in different  positions. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the required area of the smallest square-shaped box (expressed, of course, in unit squares of the aforementioned coordinate system). </p>
