### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie is training for her next race by running on a path that includes hills so that she will be prepared for any terrain. She has planned a straight path and wants to run as far as she can -- but she must be back to the farm within M seconds (1 <= M <= 10,000,000).</p>

<p>The entire path she has chosen is T units (1 <= T <= 100,000) in length and consists of equal-length portions that are uphill, flat, or downhill. The input data describes path segment i with a single character S_i that is u, f, or d, indicating respectively uphill, flat, or downhill.</p>

<p>Bessie takes U seconds (1 <= U <= 100) to run one unit of uphill path, F (1 <= F <= 100) seconds for a unit of flat path, and D (1 <= D <= 100) seconds for a unit of downhill path.  Note that, when returning home, uphill paths become downhill paths and downhill paths become uphill paths.</p>

<p>Find the farthest distance Bessie can get from the farm and still make it back in time.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Five space-separated integers: M, T, U, F, and D</li>
	<li>Lines 2..T+1: Line i+1 describes path segment i with a single letter: S_i</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer that is the farthest distance (number of units) that Bessie can get from the farm and make it back in time.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
