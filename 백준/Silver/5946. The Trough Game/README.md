### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John and Bessie are playing games again. This one has to do with troughs of water.</p>

<p>Farmer John has hidden N (1 <= N <= 20) troughs behind the barn, and has filled some of them with food. Bessie has asked M (1 <= M <= 100) questions of the form, "How many troughs from this list (which she recites) are filled?".</p>

<p>Bessie needs your help to deduce which troughs are actually filled.</p>

<p>Consider an example with four troughs where Bessie has asked these questions (and received the indicated answers):</p>

<pre>    1) "How many of these troughs are filled: trough 1"
       -->  1 trough is filled

    2) "How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 2 and 3"
       -->  1 trough is filled

    3) "How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 1 and 4"
       -->  1 trough is filled

    4) "How many of these troughs are filled: troughs 3 and 4"
       -->  1 trough is filled</pre>

<ul>
	<li>From question 1, we know trough 1 is filled.</li>
	<li>From question 3, we then know trough 4 is empty.</li>
	<li>From question 4, we then know that trough 3 is filled.</li>
	<li>From question 2, we then know that trough 2 is empty.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M</li>
	<li>Lines 2..M+1: A subset of troughs, specified as a sequence of contiguous N 0's and 1's, followed by a single integer that is the number of troughs in the specified subset that are filled.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single line with:
	<ul>
		<li>The string "IMPOSSIBLE" if there is no possible set of filled troughs compatible with Farmer John's answers.</li>
		<li>The string "NOT UNIQUE" if Bessie cannot determine from the given data exactly what troughs are filled.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, a sequence of contiguous N 0's and 1's specifying which troughs are filled.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
